"How Seawater Temperature Affects Sea Otter Mortality due to Toxoplasmosis"

One file corresponds to matplotlib graphics for the research paper. The other file contains code for calculating the odds ratio, with hardcoded values for determining seawater temperature. The code gathers Toxoplasmosis infection and otter data from on the "mont.csv" file.

Thank you for reading and your interest in conservation.
